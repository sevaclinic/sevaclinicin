<h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>

<p>
This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or seek a refund for a product /
service that you have purchased through the Platform.
</p>

<h2>Cancellations</h2>

<p>
Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within <strong>3 days</strong> of placing the 
order. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have already been 
communicated to our sellers or merchants listed on the Platform and they have initiated the 
shipping process, or if the product is out for delivery. In such cases, you may choose to reject the 
product at the doorstep.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> BIBEKANANDA PAL does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like 
flowers, eatables, etc. Refund/replacement may be provided only if the user establishes that the 
quality of the delivered product is defective.
</p>

<h2>Damaged or Defective Products</h2>

<p>
In case you receive damaged or defective items, please report the issue to our customer service 
team. The request will be processed once the seller or merchant listed on the Platform checks and 
confirms the issue. This must be reported within <strong>3 days</strong> of receiving the product.
</p>

<h2>Product Not as Shown / Not as Expected</h2>

<p>
If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or does not meet your 
expectations, you must notify our customer service within <strong>3 days</strong> of receiving the product. 
After reviewing your complaint, the customer service team will take an appropriate decision.
</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Warranty Products</h2>

<p>
For items with a manufacturer warranty, you are requested to contact the manufacturer directly 
for support, repair, or replacement as applicable.
</p>

<h2>Refund Timelines</h2>

<p>
If a refund request is approved by <strong>BIBEKANANDA PAL</strong>, it will take up to <strong>7 days</strong> for the 
refund to be processed to you.
